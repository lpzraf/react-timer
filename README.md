## Timer with React JS
Wrote this timer with Set and Clear Intervals in React from a tutorial I watched in YouTube. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To demo the mini project, clone the repo to your machine, go to it's directory and run: `npm start`
